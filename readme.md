# Skyrim statsmenu updated decompilation

An updated version of the Skyrim Statsmenu (skill menu) decompilation from [SkyrimUI](https://github.com/Mardoxx/skyrimui) that works with the most recent releases of the game. (LE/SE/AE)

## Why does this exist?

At some point since the [SkyrimUI](https://github.com/Mardoxx/skyrimui) project was completed, the Statsmenu swf was significantly overhauled and if you tried to build and use the old one it would bug out in game. 

This is a fresh decompilation that has been cleaned up and made to produce an output that seems to be either identical or at least pretty damn close to the new one.

## Permission Instructions

Same as the original SkyrimUI project, you may use the decompiled/reconstructed vanilla source files in your mod without explicit permission. 

I am not the original author of this code ( doubly so because this also uses some of the cleaned up functions from SkyrimUI ) however, doing this took a lot of effort so please chuck me (and a link to this page) in your projects credits 👍.

## Build Instructions

1. Download this repository.
2. Unpack your Interfaces bsa (found in your skyrim install folder).
3. From the unpacked bsa, take gfxfontlib.swf and put it in the /src/ folder of this project.
4. Open the .fla in Adobe CS6 and and select File > Publish.
5. The newly built copy of the menu should be in the /build/ folder.
